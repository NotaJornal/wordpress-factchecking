# Schema.org Fact Checking para WordPress


## Sobre o plugin
This is a WordPress plugin that allows publishers to add the new  [ClaimReview - schema.org](http://schema.org/ClaimReview) schema for publishing factchecking reports to their posts. 

You can read more about the labeling of fact checking articles in [Labeling fact-check articles in Google News](https://blog.google/topics/journalism-news/labeling-fact-check-articles-google-news/).


### Adding ClaimReview Schema to posts

Claims are separate from posts and can be reused  - and are defined as a Custom Post Type. 

For the post types enabled above, a new metabox will appear in the right column when editing a post. 

You can search for existing ClaimReviews, or create new ones. 

Save/Publish your post, and your new ClaimReview Schema data will be added to the HTML when the post renders. 



## Contributing to the development of this plugin

This is a simple start - there is much to be done. Please contribute to make this a well rounded and useful plugin. 

To make development easier I have added a [`docker-compose` configuration](./docker-compose.yml), which will allow  you to spin up a local version of a wordpress site in Docker Containers and focus on developing the functionality of this plugin.

This is not a requirement, but I find it a useful way to work. [Read more about setting up docker in your development environment](https://www.docker.com)
